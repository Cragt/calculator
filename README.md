# calculator

A simple calculator webapp using JavaScript, HTML, & CSS.

Things to note:

1. I view added sounds on buttons as a bit redundant, but I did it anyway for practice. Mute button is positioned under the calculator.

2. I'd like to implement a "second" display above the main one that shows the operation being performed.

3. I'd like to enable keypress functionality in the future.
